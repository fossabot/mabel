# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The head of the current and previous minor version are supported for functional and security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.4.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 0.3  | :x:                |

[Feature Labels](https://github.com/joocer/mabel/projects/1) have the following meaning:

| Label      | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Proposed   | Feature in design/discussion/prototype |
| Alpha      | Feature subject to change, no support |
| Beta       | Feature likely to contain bugs, breaking changes unlikely, not recommended for production use, limited support |
| GA (No Label) | Feature complete and operational, supported |
| Deprecation Target | Feature will be removed in next minor version, limited support |
| Deprecated | Feature no longer available, no support |

All features in supported versions have security support regardless of Label.

_Alpha_ or _Deprecation Target_ features may be removed out of the pattern above to address security weaknesses.
